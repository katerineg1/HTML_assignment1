                <h4>Piper Bellinger is fashionable, influential, and her reputation as a wild child means the paparazzi are constantly on her heels. 
                    When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. 
                    So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father’s dive bar in Washington.
                    Piper hasn’t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won’t last a week 
                    outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can’t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. 
                    How bad could it really be? She’s determined to show her stepfather—and the hot, grumpy local—that she’s more than a pretty face.
